## Analyze a call center conversation

- Input text:

  ```
  Employee: "Hello, this is Julia Schreider from Contoso Company. How can I help you today?"
  Customer: "Hi, I am Carsten Mueller. I ordered a package 10 days ago, on February 10th, and it was supposed to arrive in maximum 5 business days. I have called three times already and nobody could provide any more information. I want to know where the package is and I want the problem to be solved immediately. This is the worst service I had for a long time!"
  Employee: "I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. Mueller. I understand your frustration and I'm here to help. Can you please provide me with your order number so I can look into this for you?"
  Customer: "Yes, it's ACZ456789."
  Employee: "Thank you. I'm looking into it now. Can you please hold for a few minutes while I check the status of your package?"
  Customer: "Okay."
  Employee: "Thank you for your patience. I am sorry to inform you that I am unable to find the status of your package. It appears to have left the sending address, but no up-to-date status on the current location. I will further investigate your case and get back to you as soon as possible via phone call. Could you please provide me your contact information?"
  Customer: "Ah not again. Anyway, my phone number is +4911112223344."
  Employee: "I apologize again for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
  Customer: "No."
  Employee: "Thank you. Have a great day!"
